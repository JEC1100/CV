# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Hello there! I'm James, a passionate junior full-stack developer from Newcastle. 
I love problem-solving and am very excited to find a great first role to continue learning and make significant meaningful contributions to a product. 


I love ideas, concepts, thinking around and researching smart user stories. Technology has come so far in terms of how easy it has made everything for the user. The developer's journey appears to be benefitting from this now. 

We are living through exhilarating times. Continuous deployment and faster implementation for new features make the hit rates that much higher.

My core goal at present is to spend each day upskilling as a developer. 
I am most excited about joining a busy team and working in new tech stacks.


## Skills
- **Languages**: Experience in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C#. 
- **Excellent Communicator**: 
I'm a big fan of speaking to someone face-to-face to solve an issue quicker and with less room for misinterpretation and assumptions made in messaging.
- **Customer Focussed**:
I find genuine empathy: the ability to be the person you're talking to, the user whose problem you're solving, is vital in making any connection real. 
- **Organised**:
Organised is a state - rather than a completed to-do list - which keeps me battle-ready, ready to take instruction, or give it when the winds change.
- **Curious**:
My curiosity manifests as a willingness to try different approaches to solve programming problems or come at an idea. This is because a solution often comes out of the leftfield of a different path you were open to exploring.
- **Pragmatic**:
I'm offence-proof when it comes to being moulded, taught, and critiqued, and I respect the feelings, emotions, and needs at all times.

## Proudest Achievements
  - Completing Maker's Course, software Bootcamp based in London.
  - "Action" Intern for development and production office at Working Title.
  - Being a proactive self-led learner in all that I do in life.
  - Being a loving father to my wonderful little daughter.

## What I'm working on
-	I am currently consolidating my learning at Makers by addressing every course material a second time around. I'm also building a React and JavaScript Web App planner.

## What I'd like to work on
For personal projects, I'd like to work on a generic booking bot that removes the need to log on to a website at a weird and early time once per week to try to book your slot. Swimming/golf/zoo tickets/gymnastics.
and, secondly:
A buddy system that connects a network of women to reach out to another pair of buddies for help should they ever feel unsafe.

For professional projects, I'd like to work on:
- Projects that involve a new tech stack I have yet to grapple with much.
- Projects that see a rapid turnover of user stories to deployment but that also involve a good amount of testing wherever practically possible. 

I'd love to work in a role focused on AI eventually - but in terms of data science and machine learning, it's out of my current scope of knowledge.

## Personal Interests
I love ideas, concepts, lateral thinking problems, researching speculative technologies, and writing dystopian fiction. Playing cards, Go. I love Super Cities. I run and take long walks with my dog, where I often find some of my best solutions to problems bubble up. My daughter and I can build almost anything out of Play-Doh now.
