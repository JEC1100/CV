I'm James; a personable, energetic optician turned full-stack Junior Software Developer seeking a back- end-centric role at an agile company. After graduating from Manchester University with a BSc in Optics, I graduated from York St John University with a degree in the mechanics of Film Production. I love science, and I love ideas.
