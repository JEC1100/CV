# Hello there! üëã
I'm James, a personable, energetic optician turned full-stack Junior Software Developer seeking a full-stack role at an agile company. I did a degree in Optics then a degree in Film. I love science, and I love ideas. So I started to read around programming while teaching myself to create code via SoloLearn, Codecademy, YouTube tutorials. Finally, I began building things at Makers, an intensive four-month Bootcamp. I loved it. The sheer possibility of it all struck me: the opportunity to work in so many emerging, in some cases, yet-to-exist fields; its accessibility, and the self-revelation that I love working as part of a team.

## Skills
- **Can quickly learn technologies**: 
Makers taught me how to be a self-sufficient software engineer. I was thrilled to discover how transferrable fundamentals were to a new language or tech stacks, Node.js, JavaScript, Express, CSS, Jest. For example, when translating my Maker's Ruby Airport challenge to JS. 
- **Languages**:  
Experience in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. English.
- **Excellent Communicator**: 
I'm a big fan of speaking to someone to solve an issue faster. I often find problems can be traced back to assumptions made in a written message which were maybe avoidable with a minute on a zoom call.
- **Customer Focussed**:
Genuine empathy‚Äîthe ability to be the person you talk to, the user whose problem you solve‚Äî is vital in making any connection real.
- **Organised**:
Organised is a state - rather than an empty to-do list - which keeps me primed to give my all to the most pressing task when the winds change.
- **Curious**:
My curiosity manifests as a willingness to try different approaches to solve programming problems or come at an idea. A solution often springs out of the leftfield from the number of different paths one is willing to explore.
- **Pragmatic**:
I‚Äôm my own strictest critic, and I strive for improvement in all that I do. I‚Äôm offence-proof when it comes to being moulded, critiqued, and taught. All feedback is a gift: the gift of a lesson, especially when you might do things differently or better next time, as a direct consequence.
