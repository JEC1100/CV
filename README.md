# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm James; a creative, personable, energetic optician turned **Full-Stack Developer** seeking a challenging role at an agile company. I did a degree in Optics then a degree in Film. I love science, and I love ideas. Inspired by my peers and the tech/start-up culture, I finally decided to make the switch to Software Engineering. I started reading about programming while teaching myself to create code via SoloLearn, Codecademy, and YouTube tutorials. Finally, I began building things at Makers, an intensive four-month Bootcamp. I loved it. The sheer possibility of it all struck me: the opportunity to work in so many emerging, in some cases, yet-to-exist fields; its accessibility, and the self-revelation that I love working as part of a team.

## Skills
- **Can quickly learn technologies**: 
Makers taught me how to be a self-sufficient software engineer. I was thrilled to discover how transferrable fundamentals were to a new language or tech stacks, Node.js, JavaScript, Express, CSS, Jest. For example, when translating my Maker's Ruby Airport challenge to JS. 
- **Languages**:  
Experience in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. English.
- **Excellent Communicator**: 
I'm a big fan of speaking to someone to solve an issue faster. I often find problems can be traced back to assumptions made in a written message which were maybe avoidable with a minute on a zoom call or phone call. In my role as an optometrist, this often meant the difference between saving someone's sight by communicating efficiently and directly with the hospital on-call consultant or not. 
- **Customer Focussed**:
Genuine empathyâ€”the ability to be the person you talk to, the user whose problem you solveâ€” is vital in making any connection real. All my patients feel I have listened to them. 
- **Organised**:
Organised is a state - rather than an empty to-do list - which keeps me primed to give my all to the most pressing task when the winds change. I managed two lines of work and a second degree in this state.
- **Curious**:
My curiosity manifests as a willingness to try different approaches to solve programming problems or come with an idea. A solution often springs out of the leftfield from the number of different paths one is willing to explore. My humility, lack of ego, and wonder have led me to solve business and clinical problems at work, as well as logistical ones. As an intern, when a department head required the impossible, I saw to deliver it.
- **Pragmatic**:
I'm my own strictest critic, and I strive for improvement in all that I do. I'm offence-proof when it comes to being moulded, critiqued, and taught. All feedback is a gift: the gift of a lesson, especially when you might do things differently or better next time, as a direct consequence. I understand why a company must be bigger and more important than its many parts, and that: **adding to this equation is our job**.

## Experience
- **Makers Academy, London (May 2021 â€“ Oct 2021)**:
**Trainee full-stack software developer** - I built full-stack software in teams employing OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD, Ruby, RSpec, Rails, JavaScript, Jasmine, Node, React, PostgreSQL, deployment. 
- **Codebar, Edinburgh & Code Your Future, London (Sept 2021 - present)**:
**Volunteer Coach** - I enlisted to Teach Coding Fundamentals to Refugees and Disadvantaged People. Awaiting the next class after participating in their AWS deployment workshop.
- **Specsavers Optical Group, Guernsey (Jan 2011 - April 2021)**:
**Qualified Optician** - I covered joint-venture partnership companies nationwide. Served eye care and retail needs of large cities, small town-based companies. I ran clinics independently, wherein decisions from any angle resided with me. I worked quickly **and** carefully, realising it's okay to reflect and figure out what to do next, but don't spend all day over it. 
- **Sony Music HQ, London (Sept 2009 - Jan 2011)**:
**Remote Researcher** - Headhunted by Film Music Supervisor Nick Angel. I combed Sony's Catalogue for creative ideas, pitching these at bi-weekly stand-ups to Nick, who then considered the best of these ideas for A-List Creative Producers.
- **Working Title Films HQ, London (May 2008- Jul 2009)**:
**Graduate "Action" Intern (one of two selected from 2000 applicants)** Communicating between movie development and production departments, managing diaries, meetings, schedules, keeping documentation up to date. In addition, I made creative links between newspaper and journal articles and potential film ideas. The company created a meeting slot solely for me to pitch these ideas, for Working Title to disseminate and distribute to their writers. I worked on the Matt Damon Film, Green Zone, at Shepperton Studios, Nanny McPhee and The Big Bang, on location, The Cohen Brothers' A Serious Man, and with Robert Downey Jnr in The Soloist.
