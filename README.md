# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm James; a personable, energetic optician turned full-stack Junior Software Developer seeking a back- end-centric role at an agile company. After graduating from Manchester University with a BSc in Optics, I graduated from York St John University with a degree in the mechanics of Film Production. I love science, and I love ideas. Before working life, I gained experience in family Dental and Optical practices and observed shortcomings in the note-taking aspects of their esoteric software. My cousin, who started the e-commerce enterprise "Netalogue", saw the niche gap I had identified in dentistry and optics, and he was keen for us to work on this. By total chance, in my first job, the entrepreneurial optician I worked for was designing software for use within his practice, which he would later make available to other franchises. I helped in the early deliveries with testing its performance at the user end, which provided my first taste of development, the user-developer feedback loop. I continued to help but felt frustrated at not having any programming knowledge, preventing me from delving into this field myself first. I read a book on website design, but this didn't stick with me. In 2019, I started to read around programming while teaching myself to create code via SoloLearn, Codecademy, YouTube tutorials. Finally, I began building things at Makers, an intensive four-month Bootcamp. I loved it. The sheer possibility of it all struck me: the opportunity to work in so many emerging, in some cases, yet-to-exist fields; its accessibility, and the self-revelation that I love working as part of a team.

## Skills
- **Can quickly learn technologies**: 
Makers taught me how to be a self-sufficient software engineer. I was thrilled to discover how transferrable fundamentals were to a new language or tech stacks, Node.js, JavaScript, Express, CSS, Jest.
- **Languages**:  
Experience in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. English.
- **Excellent Communicator**: 
I'm a big fan of speaking to someone to solve an issue faster. I often find problems can be traced back to assumptions made in a written message which were maybe avoidable with a minute on a zoom call.
- **Customer Focussed**:
Genuine empathyâ€”the ability to be the person you talk to, the user whose problem you solveâ€” is vital in making any connection real.
