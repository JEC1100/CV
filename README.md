# Hello there! üëã
I'm James. I'm a personable, creative, energetic optician turned **Full-Stack Developer** seeking a challenging role at an agile company. I did a degree in Optics then a degree in Film. I love science, and I love ideas. Inspired by my peers and the tech/start-up culture, I finally uncovered the fire in which to forge a permanent link between my creative and technical passions by making the switch to Software Engineering. I started reading about programming while teaching myself to create code via SoloLearn, Codecademy, and YouTube tutorials. Finally, I began building things at Makers, an intensive four-month Bootcamp. I loved it. The sheer possibility of it all struck me: the opportunity to work in so many emerging, in some cases, yet-to-exist fields; its accessibility, and the self-revelation that I love working as part of a team.
