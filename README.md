# Hello there! üëã
I'm James; a personable, energetic optician turned full-stack Junior Software Developer seeking a back- end-centric role at an agile company. After graduating from Manchester University with a BSc in Optics, I graduated from York St John University with a degree in the mechanics of Film Production. I love science, and I love ideas. Before working life, I gained experience in family Dental and Optical practices and observed shortcomings in the note-taking aspects of their esoteric software. My cousin, who started the e-commerce enterprise "Netalogue", saw the niche gap I had identified in dentistry and optics, and he was keen for us to work on this. By total chance, in my first job, the entrepreneurial optician I worked for was designing software for use within his practice, which he would later make available to other franchises. I helped in the early deliveries with testing its performance at the user end, which provided my first taste of development, the user-developer feedback loop. I continued to help but felt frustrated at not having any programming knowledge, preventing me from delving into this field myself first. I read a book on website design, but this didn't stick with me. In 2019, I started to read around programming while teaching myself to create code via SoloLearn, Codecademy, YouTube tutorials. Finally, I began building things at Makers, an intensive four-month Bootcamp. I loved it. The sheer possibility of it all struck me: the opportunity to work in so many emerging, in some cases, yet-to-exist fields; its accessibility, and the self-revelation that I love working as part of a team.

## Skills
- **Can quickly learn technologies**: 
Makers taught me how to be a self-sufficient software engineer. I was thrilled to discover how transferrable fundamentals were to a new language or tech stacks, Node.js, JavaScript, Express, CSS, Jest.
- **Languages**:  
Experience in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. English.
- **Excellent Communicator**: 
I'm a big fan of speaking to someone to solve an issue faster. I often find problems can be traced back to assumptions made in a written message which were maybe avoidable with a minute on a zoom call.
- **Customer Focussed**:
Genuine empathy‚Äîthe ability to be the person you talk to, the user whose problem you solve‚Äî is vital in making any connection real.
- **Organised**:
Organised is a state - rather than an empty to-do list - which keeps me primed to give my all to the most pressing task when the winds change.
- **Curious**:
My curiosity manifests as a willingness to try different approaches to solve programming problems or come at an idea. A solution often springs out of the leftfield from the number of different paths one is willing to explore.
- **Pragmatic**:
I‚Äôm my own strictest critic, and I strive for improvement in all that I do. I‚Äôm offence-proof when it comes to being moulded, critiqued, and taught. All feedback is a gift: the gift of a lesson, especially when you might do things differently or better next time, as a direct consequence.
A third-party reviewer recently made the observations below about how I coded during a live tech test:
```
You have clarified the requirements well and also asked good questions about some of the finer 
```
```
You were very vocal about your process and the decisions that you have made. 
```
```
The algorithm that you created made logical sense and was a good solution for this particular problem.
```
```
Your test progression made complete logical sense. You used TDD to make incremental transformations.
``` 
```
Your tests were behaviour-based, client-oriented, with acceptance criteria properly encoded in the algorithm.
``` 
```
You are very fluent with Ruby and RSpec syntax and language constructs.
```
