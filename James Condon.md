# Hello there! üëã
I'm James; a personable, energetic optician turned full-stack Junior Software Developer seeking a back- end-centric role at an agile company. After graduating from Manchester University with a BSc in Optics, I graduated from York St John University with a degree in the mechanics of Film Production. I love science, and I love ideas. Before working life, I gained experience in family Dental and Optical practices and observed shortcomings in the note-taking aspects of their esoteric software. My cousin, who started the e-commerce enterprise "Netalogue", saw the niche gap I had identified in dentistry and optics, and he was keen for us to work on this. By total chance, in my first job, the entrepreneurial optician I worked for was designing software for use within his practice, which he would later make available to other franchises. I helped in the early deliveries with testing its performance at the user end, which provided my first taste of development, the user-developer feedback loop. I continued to help but felt frustrated at not having any programming knowledge, preventing me from delving into this field myself first. I read a book on website design, but this didn't stick with me. In 2019, I started to read around programming while teaching myself to create code via SoloLearn, Codecademy, YouTube tutorials. Finally, I began building things at Makers, an intensive four-month Bootcamp. I loved it. The sheer possibility of it all struck me: the opportunity to work in so many emerging, in some cases, yet-to-exist fields; its accessibility, and the self-revelation that I love working as part of a team.

## Skills
- **Can quickly learn technologies**: 
Makers taught me how to be a self-sufficient software engineer. I was pleasantly suprised how transferrable the fundamentals were to the new tech and language as we used; for example, my final project involved learning Node.js, Javascript, Express, CSS, Jest and Puppeteer. As a result I'm doing a solo project with similar tools.
- **Languages**: Experience in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C#. 
- **Excellent Communicator**: 
I'm a big fan of speaking to someone face-to-face to solve an issue quicker and with less room for misinterpretation and assumptions made in messaging. I often find problems can be traced back to an assumption made in a written line of commnication which may have been avoided had there been a quick word in person or a zoom call.
- **Customer Focussed**:
I find genuine empathy: the ability to be the person you're talking to, the user whose problem you're solving, is vital in making any connection real. 
- **Organised**:
Organised is a state - rather than a completed to-do list - which keeps me battle-ready, ready to take instruction, or give it when the winds change.
- **Curious**:
My curiosity manifests as a willingness to try different approaches to solve programming problems or come at an idea. This is because a solution often comes out of the leftfield of a different path you were open to exploring.
- **Pragmatic**:
I'm offence-proof when it comes to being moulded, taught, and critiqued, and I respect the feelings, emotions, and needs at all times.

A thirdy-party reviewer recently said of my coding during a live tech test: 

```
You have clarified the requirements well and also asked good questions about some of the finer details.
```
```
You were very vocal about your process and the decisions that you have made. 
```
```
The algorithm that you created made logical sense and was a good solution for this particular problem.
```
```
Your test progression made complete logical sense. You used TDD to make incremental transformations.
``` 
```
Your tests were behaviour-based, client-oriented, with acceptance criteria properly encoded in the algorithm.
``` 
```
You are very fluent with Ruby and RSpec syntax and language constructs.
```

## Proudest Achievements
  - Completing Maker's Course, software Bootcamp based in London, and completing and presenting our final project, Key-J, together.
  - Being accepted on to Working Title Films coveted "Action Internship Programme".
  - Being a proactive self-led learner in all that I do in life.
  - Being a loving father to my wonderful little daughter.

## What I'm working on
-	I am currently consolidating my learning at Makers by addressing every course material a second time around. I'm also building a Contacts App in Rails, a React and JavaScript Web App Planner. I loved using these stacks and working in teams the most at Makers but would like more personal exposure to these technonologies now 

## What I'd like to work on
For personal projects, I'd like to work on a generic booking bot that removes the need to log on to a website at a weird and early time once per week to try to book your slot. Swimming/golf/zoo tickets/gymnastics.
and, secondly:
A buddy system that connects a network of women to reach out to another pair of buddies for help should they ever feel unsafe.

For professional projects, I'd like to work on:
- Projects that involve a new tech stack I have yet to grapple with much.
- Projects that see a rapid turnover of user stories to deployment but that also involve a good amount of testing wherever practically possible. 

I'd love to work in a role focused on AI eventually but in terms of data science and ML, it's outside my current scope of understanding. I'm also fascianted by  the change we are seeing in money and how we define it, transport it, and store it, as for the first time in history, tech seems to be dictating what money will become.

## Personal Interests
I love ideas, concepts, lateral thinking problems, researching speculative technologies, and writing dystopian fiction. Playing cards, Go. I love Super Cities. I run and take long walks with my dog, where I often find some of my best solutions to problems bubble up. My daughter and I can build anything out of Play-Doh now.
